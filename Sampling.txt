## Questions on Sampling

Question 1: The Literary Digest Poll
In 1936, the Literary Digest reported results of a sample to predict the winner of that year's presidential race. It predicted the spectacularly incorrect result that Landon would win in a landslide over Roosevelt. Do some research to read about this event and the fallout for the Literary Digest. (Just Google it!) Then discuss the following questions. 
(a) Was the Literary Digest sample a probability sample? Explain why or why not. 

(b) What caused  the incorrect prediction? Answer this in your own words, using the technical terminology of sampling. Do NOT copy and paste anything from an article you found.Question 2: Survey vs. ExperimentYour professor is working on a project for NOAA (who is responsible for US marine fisheries) to try to figure out how to best sample recreational marine fisherman to find out how many fish they caught. In previous studies of this problem, we tried drawing a simple random sample from the license list and mailing a questionnaire to the sampled anglers (rather than collecting data by phone, as is done now). To investigate whether or not incentives help in getting people to respond, the sampled anglers were put in three random groups, and each group received  either $1, $5, or nothing with their questionnaire, and the response rate of each group was recorded.Is this a sample or an experiment? If a sample, (1) is it a probability sample and (2) what are the sampling units? If an experiment, (1) which of the three features of good experiments are present, which are not, and which can you not tell about, (2) what is the treatment, and (3) what is the response?
