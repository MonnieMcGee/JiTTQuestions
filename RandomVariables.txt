In class you were introduced to the idea of the mean and the standard deviation of a random variable. At the beginning of the semester, you were introduced to the mean and the standard deviation of a set of data. Explain how the population mean and the sample mean are related. How are they the same (i.e., how can they both have the name "mean") and how are they different (what are they measuring that is different)?
